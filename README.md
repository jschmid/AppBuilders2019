# Kotlin for Swift developers

This is the associated repo for the talk I gave at [App Builders 2019](https://appbuilders.ch/).

It shows iOS/Android apps in [Swift](Swift)/[Kotlin](Kotlin).

Slides are [available on Speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/jschmid/kotlin-for-swift-developers) and were generated with Deckset.

## Running the apps

You will need to run [the demo server](server) locally or change to the server url to `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`.
